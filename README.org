* Equation Grapher
[[./demo.png]]

Graph equations and save them into ~.ppm~ files.

* Installation
#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/shoumodip/graph
$ cd graph
$ cc -o graph graph.c
#+end_src

* Usage
#+begin_src console
$ graph [EQUATION] [FLAG]
$ graph "2x"
$ graph "2x" "x2 - 3"
$ graph "2x" "x2 - 3" -o "poly.ppm"
$ graph "2x" "x2 - 3" -o "poly.ppm" -f "#ff0000" -b "#ffffff"
#+end_src

* Equations
An equation is a summation of terms. A term is of the form ~SxP~.

- ~S~ is the scalar
- ~x~ is the variable (~x~)
- ~P~ is the power of the variable

Some examples:
- ~2*x^2 - 3x + 5~ is written as ~2x2 - 3x + 5~
- ~2*x + 69~ is written as ~2x + 69~
- ~x + 5~ is written as ~x + 5~
- ~7~ is written as ~7~

Whitespace is ignored and can be placed anywhere.
